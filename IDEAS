- stack-based language
- written in Python (2.6 probably)
- Python bridge
- NO local vars; use stack instead (that is the idea anyway)
- reuse ideas from llizard/manta: stack of stacks, lambda-words, etc
- NO forward declarations like Cat, Forth, Factor, etc;
  don't use:    : foo ... ;
  rather:       :foo ( ...words... ) defword
  or something like that!
- use short names; put special characters to good use
- unicode? (e.g. UTF-16)
- use substitution when executing words
- symbols
- use Python data types where possible
- use functional stuff where possible? i.e. immutable
- global namespace holds words and variables
- modules?
- dictionaries?


later:

- demo program: use Python/Tkinter turtle
